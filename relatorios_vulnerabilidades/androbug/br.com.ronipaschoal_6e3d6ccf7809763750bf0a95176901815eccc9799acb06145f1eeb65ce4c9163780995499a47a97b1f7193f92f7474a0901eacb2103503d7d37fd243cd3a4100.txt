[Critical] <Debug> Android Debug Mode Checking:
           DEBUG mode is ON(android:debuggable="true") in AndroidManifest.xml. This is very dangerous. The attackers will be able to sniffer
           the debug messages by Logcat. Please disable the DEBUG mode if it is a released application.
[Warning] <SSL_Security> SSL Certificate Verification Checking:
           Please make sure this app has the conditions to check the validation of SSL Certificate. If it's not properly checked, it MAY
           allows self-signed, expired or mismatch CN certificates for SSL connection.
           This is a critical vulnerability and allows attackers to do MITM attacks without your knowledge.
           If you are transmitting users' username or password, these sensitive information may be leaking.

           (3)https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=134807561
           This vulnerability is much more severe than Apple's "goto fail" vulnerability: http://goo.gl/eFlovw
           Please do not try to create a "X509Certificate" and override "checkClientTrusted", "checkServerTrusted", and "getAcceptedIssuers"
           functions with blank implementation.
           We strongly suggest you use the existing API instead of creating your own X509Certificate class.
           Please modify or remove these vulnerable code:
